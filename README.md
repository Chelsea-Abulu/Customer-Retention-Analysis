# Customer Retention Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer retention and churn rates using the dataset to identify key insights and recommendations for improving customer engagement and revenue.

**Tool Used:** - Power BI

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency across all entries. This step was crucial to prepare the data for accurate analysis and visualization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer several key questions, such as:
- What is the total number of customers?
- What is the churn rate?
- What is the retention rate?
- What are the average monthly charges?
- Are there any significant trends in customer demographics?

### Data Analysis:
In-depth analysis was performed to understand the underlying patterns and trends within the customer data, focusing on retention, churn, and customer spending habits.
Below are the DAX formulas used to calculate the churn and retention rates, which provide key metrics for understanding customer behavior.

### Key Findings:
- **Customer Demographics:** The dataset comprises 7,043 customers, with males representing 50.5% (3,556) and females 49.5% (3,487).
- **Retention and Churn:** The retention rate is 73.46%, while the churn rate stands at 26.54%.
- **Revenue Insights:** Total charges across all customers amounted to $16.06 million, with an average monthly charge per customer of $64.76.

### Analysis:
- **Gender Distribution:** The nearly equal split between male and female customers suggests a balanced customer base. However, further analysis could identify gender-specific preferences or pain points affecting retention differently.
- **Retention vs. Churn:** While a 73.46% retention rate is positive, the 26.54% churn rate indicates a significant portion of customers leaving. Understanding the reasons behind this churn should be a priority.
- **Revenue Insights:** The total charges and average monthly charges indicate moderate customer spending. Itâ€™s important to explore whether these charges are perceived as fair and if there are opportunities to increase value without causing dissatisfaction.

### Recommendations:
- **Enhance Workforce Diversity and Inclusion:** A diverse team can better understand and connect with customers, helping to serve a broader customer base more effectively.
- **Create Customer Engagement Strategies:** Develop ways to engage all customers, regardless of gender, through personalized offers, loyalty programs, or promotions that appeal to everyone.
- **Gather and Act on Customer Feedback:** Regularly solicit feedback from customers through surveys or other methods, and use this feedback to improve services and address issues that could lead to dissatisfaction.
